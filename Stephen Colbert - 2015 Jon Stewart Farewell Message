Jon, I’ve been asked and have the privilege to say something to you that is not on the prompter right now. Here’s the thing, Jon, you said to me and to many other people here years ago never to thank you because we owe you nothing. It is one of the few times I’ve known you to be dead wrong.

We owe you … and not just what you did for our career by employing us to come on this tremendous show that you made … we owe you because we learned from you. We learned from you by example how to do a show with intention, how to work with clarity, how to treat people with respect. You are infuriatingly good at your job. And all of us who were lucky enough to work with you for 16 years are better at our jobs because we got to watch you do yours. And we are better people for having known you.

You are a great artist and a good man and personally, I do not know how this son of a poor Appalachian turd miner … I do not know what I would do if you had not brought me on this show. I’d be back in those hills mining turds with Pappy. Jon, you know by now I’d have Dung Lung. So Jon, I know you are not asking for this, but on behalf of all those people whose lives you have changed over the last 16 years, thank you. And now, I believe your line is … and correct me if I’m wrong … ‘We’ll be right back.’”
