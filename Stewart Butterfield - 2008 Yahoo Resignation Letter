Sub­ject: Resignation

Dear Brad,

As you know, tin is in my blood. For generations my family has worked with this most useful of metals. When I joined Yahoo! back in ’21, it was a sheet-tin concern of great momentum, growth and innovation. I knew it was the place for me.

Over the decades as the company grew and expanded, first into dies and punches, into copper, corrugated steel, synthesized rubber, piping, milling equipment, engines, instruments, weaponry and so on, I still felt at home because tin was the core of the business…

Since the late 80s, as the general manufacturing, oil exploration and refining, logistics and hotel and casino divisions rose to prominence, I have felt somewhat sidelined.

By the time of the internet revolution and our expansion into Web Sites, I have been cast adrift. I tried to roll with the times, but nary a sheet of tin has rolled of our own production lines in over 30 years.

In my 87 years service, I’ve accomplished many feats, shared in the ups and downs, made great friends and learned a tremendous amount … but there is a new generation now and it would be unfair not to give them a chance. Those that started in the make-work programs of the depression, on the GI programs in the late ’40s and even those young baby boomers need their own try without us old ‘uns standing in the way.

So please accept my resignation, effective July 12. And I don’t need no fancy parties or gold watches (I still have the one from ’61 and ’76). I will be spending more time with my family, tending to my small but growing alpaca herd and of course getting back to working with tin, my first love.

Your old tin-smithing friend and colleague,

Stewart Butterfield
